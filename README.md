üïØÔ∏è Service discovery for the O&R Prometheus system.

Generates configuration for use by [the Prometheus file-based service discovery](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#%3Cfile_sd_config%3E).

We run this process in the same ECS cluster as Prometheus, writing the configuration file to EFS.

Ensure you set the `BIZ_OPS_API_KEY` environment variable.

Prometheus then loads this file with the following configuration, watching and updating on any changes.

```yaml
- job_name: health_check
  scheme: https
  metrics_path: /scrape
  scrape_interval: 60s
  file_sd_configs:
    - files:
      - /prometheus/service-discovery/health-check-service-discovery.json
  relabel_configs:
    - source_labels: [__address__]
      target_label: __param_endpoint
    - source_labels: [__address__]
      target_label: instance
    - target_label: __address__
      replacement: prometheus-health-check-exporter.in.ft.com
```

Here's an example of what `health-check-service-discovery.json` might look like.

```json
[
  {
    "targets": [
        "https://totally-a-live-system.in.ft.com/__health",
        ...
    ],
    "labels": {
      "observe": "yes"
    }
  },
  {
    "targets": [
        "https://no-wait-i-am-not-ready-system.in.ft.com/__health",
        ...
    ],
    "labels": {
      "observe": "no"
    }
  }
]
```
